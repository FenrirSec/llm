"An attacker calls a company's help desk and pretends to be an employee who forgot their password. The attacker requests for a password reset. What type of social engineering attack is this?",multiple-choice,"Phishing","Baiting","Pretexting","Tailgating",,,,,,,,,,,,3," This is an example of Pretexting. The attacker creates a fabricated scenario (pretending to be an employee who forgot their password) to convince the victim to provide certain information or take certain actions (like resetting the password).","System Hacking, Malware Threats, Sniffing, DoS, Social Engineering"
"What is banner grabbing in the context of network scanning?",multiple-choice,"Collecting network metadata","Gathering information about specific network services running on a server","Grabbing user data from a server","Capturing the company's logo from their server",,,,,,,,,,,,2," Banner grabbing is a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports.","Ethical Hacking, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis"
"What does LDAP enumeration primarily aim to extract?",multiple-choice,"Clock synchronization information","Shared resources on the network","Information about users ; groups ; computers and resources","Remote management and monitoring data",,,,,,,,,,,,3," LDAP enumeration primarily aims to extract information about users and resources on the network.","Ethical Hacking, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis"
"What process identifies weaknesses in systems; networks; or applications to ascertain security measures' efficacy?",multiple-choice,"Data Encryption","Vulnerability Assessment","Phishing","DDoS Attack",,,,,,,,,,,,2," A Vulnerability Assessment is a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system. It evaluates if the system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities and provides mitigation strategies.","Ethical Hacking, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis"
"What is TCP session hijacking?",multiple-choice,"An attack where the attacker injects malicious data into a TCP session","An attack where the attacker captures a TCP session for replay later","An attack where the attacker disconnects a TCP session","An attack where the attacker spoofs the TCP session's IP address",,,,,,,,,,,,1," TCP session hijacking is an attack where the attacker injects themselves into a TCP session between two machines, effectively 'hijacking' the session and able to insert malicious data or commands.","Session Hijacking, IDS, IPS, Web Exploitation, SQL injection"
"What is the concept of Defense in Depth in information security?",multiple-choice,"Implementing multiple layers of security measures","Defending against all possible threats","Focusing only on the most critical security threats","Using a single highly effective line of defense",,,,,,,,,,,,1," 'Defense in Depth' is a strategy that employs a series of defensive mechanisms so that if one security measure fails, another will be in place to thwart an attack.","Ethical Hacking, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis"
"Which of the following wireless encryption standards is considered the most secure as of the date of this exam?",multiple-choice,"WEP","WPA","WPA2","WPA3",,,,,,,,,,,,4," WPA3 is the latest wireless encryption standard and is considered to be the most secure. It has several improvements over its predecessor, WPA2, such as individualized data encryption and robust password-based authentication.","Wireless Networks, Mobile Hacking, Cloud Computing, IoT, OT, Cryptography"
"During the WPA authentication process : which step of the four-way handshake is used to confirm that both the client and access point have the same pairwise master key (PMK)?",multiple-choice,"First handshake","Second handshake","Third handshake","Fourth handshake",,,,,,,,,,,,3," During the third step of the WPA four-way handshake, the access point sends a message to the client confirming that they both have the same pairwise master key (PMK). This step ensures the authenticity of both the client and the access point.","Wireless Networks, Mobile Hacking, Cloud Computing, IoT, OT, Cryptography"
"As an ethical hacker; you have been hired to identify any potential vulnerabilities within a company's network. You decide to conduct a port scanning operation. Which of the following tools would be most suitable for this task?",multiple-choice,"Wireshark","Netcat","Nmap","TrueCrypt",,,,,,,,,,,,3," Nmap ('Network Mapper') is a tool used for network discovery and security auditing, which includes port scanning capabilities, making it the most suitable for the task.","Ethical Hacking, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis"
"Which evasion technique involves the attacker delivering the payload across multiple sessions or TCP packets to evade detection by an IDS?",multiple-choice,"TTL manipulation","IP fragmentation","Session splicing","IP address spoofing",,,,,,,,,,,,3," Session splicing involves an attacker delivering the payload across multiple sessions or TCP packets to evade detection by an IDS. By breaking the payload into smaller pieces and transmitting them separately, the attacker can make it more difficult for the IDS to detect the malicious activity.","Session Hijacking, IDS, IPS, Web Exploitation, SQL injection"
